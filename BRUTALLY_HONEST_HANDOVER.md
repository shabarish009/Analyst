# Brutally Honest Handover – Genesis Sprint (Stories 1.1–1.10)

## The Scroll of Triumphs
- 1.1 Primordial Scaffolding: Vite+React+TS, ESLint v9 flat config, Prettier
- 1.2 Lifeblood: Dependencies installed; node_modules + lock verified
- 1.3 Skeleton: src/* and public/ created
- 1.4 First Light: Tauri v2 scaffolded; cargo check/dev run OK; XP-styled blank window
- 1.5 Lego Bricks: Button, Window, TaskbarButton with a11y + tests
- 1.6 Horizon: Taskbar reflects open windows; integration test
- 1.7 Gateway: Start button toggles Start Menu; unit test
- 1.8 Mind: Zustand store for windows/start; components refactored; tests green
- 1.9 Awakening: ai_core with pyproject.toml; venv created; editable install; hello.py verified
- 1.10 First Synapse: Rust Tauri command invokes Python; cargo test; JS bridge + mocked test; Vite build OK

## The Crucible Log (Mandate of Hermes)
- Deletion failure due to stray `nul` file under old src-tauri; resolved using extended path prefix and verified annihilation and recreation of project directory.
- ESLint v9 migration: replaced legacy .eslintrc with flat config (eslint.config.cjs). Addressed TypeScript/DOM globals and disabled `no-undef` for TS scope.
- Tauri CLI flags mismatch: aligned with `@tauri-apps/cli init` supported flags; non-interactive init successful.
- PowerShell `&&` separator broke chained npm commands; executed in discrete commands per shell requirements.
- Vitest unhandled rejection caused by direct Tauri invoke in jsdom env; replaced with explicit mock of `@tauri-apps/api/core.invoke` to keep tests hermetic.
- Python venv creation intermittently stuck via different shells; installed/used `virtualenv` to deterministically create `ai_core/.venv` and verified existence. Performed editable install and dependency resolution (tinydb, fastapi, etc.).
- Rust path resolution corrected to repo-root anchoring to find `ai_core/hello.py` and `ai_core/.venv/Scripts/python.exe` reliably.

## Verification Summary (Absolute Zero)
- Frontend: ESLint passes; Vitest 7/7 passing; Vite build OK
- Rust: cargo test OK (py_hello integration)
- Python: ai_core venv created, editable install OK, hello.py prints success

## Repository Artifacts
- `.gitignore` updated to exclude node_modules, dist, target, and venvs
- `GENESIS_SPRINT_REVIEW.md` retained; this document is canonical under Scribe's Oath

## Next Steps
- Branch `feature/sprint-phase0` and commit sprint work.
- Await Phase 1 directive.
