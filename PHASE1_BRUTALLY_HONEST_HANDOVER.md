# Brutally Honest Handover — Phase 1: SQL Analyst (Stories 2.1–2.8)

## The Scroll of Triumphs
- 2.1 SQL Editor UI
  - CodeMirror-based SQL editor with Luna (XP) theme
  - Zustand-backed editor state; integration test verifies state reflections and edits
- 2.2 AI Core API
  - FastAPI app with POST /generate_sql (pydantic models)
  - pytest tests: placeholder/heuristic output; schema-aware path validated
- 2.3 First True Symbiosis
  - New Tauri command generate_sql invokes ai_core bridge (bridge_generate_sql.py)
  - Frontend bridge and SQLAnalyst "Generate SQL" button updates editor content
  - Integration test verifies end-to-end generation
- 2.4 Oracle’s Wisdom
  - ai_core/oracle/llm.py with optional GPT4All integration (best effort) and deterministic heuristic fallback
  - API updated to call oracle; tests mock/fallback as needed; deterministic assertions
- 2.5 Armory (DB Connection UI)
  - ConnectionManager component with Zustand dbPath; test verifies updates and status
- 2.6 Blade of Execution (Rust Query Engine)
  - Tauri commands: connect_db, execute_query, get_schema using rusqlite + once_cell
  - JSON result format: { cols, rows } for SELECT/WITH, { affected } for DML
  - Rust tests: open temp DB, create/insert/select happy path
- 2.7 Second Symbiosis (End-to-End Execution)
  - SQLAnalyst adds Run button, ResultsGrid component to display results
  - Frontend uses dbBridge to connect, run, and render
  - Integration test verifies results grid appears after run
- 2.8 Oracle’s Memory (Context-Aware AI)
  - SQLAnalyst fetches schema via Tauri and passes with prompt to AI for better SQL

## The Crucible Log (Hermes Mandate)
- CodeMirror in jsdom
  - Issue: codemirror measurement APIs crashed in tests (getClientRects not found)
  - Solution: Added minimal polyfills in Vitest setup (Range.getClientRects/boundingClientRect, Element.getClientRects)
- CodeMirror text assertion
  - Issue: editor text split across spans; initial test failed to find text
  - Solution: Assert on role="textbox" textContent with flexible regex
- Python tests collection bleed
  - Issue: external tests under repo root conflicted
  - Solution: Scope pytest run to ai_core/tests explicitly in CI commands
- Rust integration
  - Added rusqlite with bundled SQLite, created persistent connection via once_cell Mutex
  - Data mapping: returned rows as arrays; schema fetch via PRAGMA table_info

## Verification Summary (Absolute Zero)
- Frontend
  - ESLint: OK
  - Vitest: 11/11 tests pass (editor, integration, results, shell components)
  - Vite build: OK
- Rust
  - cargo test: 3/3 tests pass (hello, generate_sql json, DB connect/exec/select)
- Python
  - pytest ai_core/tests: 2/2 tests pass

## Notes
- LLM is optional and best-effort; tests rely on deterministic fallback and/or mocks
- All new code adheres to the True Vertical Slice: buttons act, chains unbroken end-to-end
